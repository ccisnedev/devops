## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Renamed the published module to macss-devops.
- Moved the publishable entrypoint to code/powershell/macss-devops.psd1.
- Added GitHub Actions publication on pushes to main when code/powershell changes and the version is newer than PSGallery.
- Added a Pester alert for PSGallery API key expiry metadata.

### Fixed
- Made Install-PSDevOpsSkill resolve SKILL.md from the package root first and from the repository root as a local-development fallback.
